# Python Coding Sessions

This folder contains Python scripts and projects for daily coding experiments and problem-solving sessions. Python is a versatile programming language widely used for data science, automation, web development, and more.

## Setup

- Ensure Python is installed (preferably Python 3.8+). Use a virtual environment for project isolation.
- Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` for projects that have them.
- For data science projects, consider installing Anaconda or Miniconda for package management.

## Organization

Files and projects are organized by purpose:

- `Data_Science_Study_for_Mathematics_Teachers/` - Weekly study materials in PDF format for data science tailored to math teachers.

## Running Scripts

### Running Python Scripts

- Open command prompt in the script's directory.
- Run: `python script_name.py` to execute the script.

### Using Virtual Environments

- Create: `python -m venv venv`
- Activate: `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- Install packages: `pip install package_name`

### Interactive Mode

- Use VS Code with Python extension for interactive development.
- Open `.py` files and use the integrated terminal for running code.

## Creating New Day Files

Use the `new_day.ps1` script in the parent directory to create new day files. It prompts for the folder name (e.g., "Python") and creates the next numbered `dayN.py` file.

## Context for Future Sessions

This workspace is part of a broader "Coding Sessions" project for daily programming challenges. Each day focuses on different concepts or problems, using Python for general-purpose programming and data analysis. Sessions may include basics, advanced features, or specific applications like data science for education.
