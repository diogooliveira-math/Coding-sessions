# Data Science Study for Mathematics Teachers

This folder contains weekly study materials in PDF format for data science concepts tailored for mathematics teachers. The materials cover Python programming fundamentals, data manipulation with Pandas, data visualization, and advanced analytics applied to educational contexts.

## Organization

Each week has its own folder containing the corresponding PDF study material:

- `week01/` - Python Fundamentals for Math Teachers
- `week02/` - Student Data Management with Pandas
- `week03/` - Classroom Data Collection and Cleaning
- `week04/` - Student Performance Visualization
- `week05/` - Predictive Analytics for Education
- `week06/` - Classroom Analytics Project
- `week07/` - Advanced Educational Analytics
- `week08/` - Implementing Data-Driven Teaching

## Accessing Materials

Navigate to each week's folder and open the PDF file to access the study materials. These resources are designed to build data science skills progressively, starting from basic programming and moving towards practical applications in education.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of mathematics
- Familiarity with computer usage
- No prior programming experience required (materials start from fundamentals)

## Additional Resources

For interactive coding exercises, refer to the [`AI-Powered_Curriculum_Generator`](https://github.com/diogooliveira-math/AI-Powered_Curriculum_Generator) project in *the parent Python folder*, which contains tools for generating customized curricula.
